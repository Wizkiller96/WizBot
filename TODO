Todo:
  ✔ Strings rework continued @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Added config/aliases.yml which contains mapping of command method names to command names + aliases @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ First alias is treated as a command name, while the following ones are treated as aliases @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Command strings' keys aren now using command name as keys (first entry in config/aliases.yml), and not command method name @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Command strings are now .yml files in config/strings/commands/commands.LANG.yml (actual localization is not yet implemented, but is trivial to add) @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Removed obsolete command strings and aliases for commands which no longer exist and added tests to check for them @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Added tests which will make sure commands.yml and aliases.yml files have entries for all commands @done(21-05-03 17:16)
    ✔ Some commands are slightly renamed to be more consistent with other commands in their group/bot @done(21-05-03 17:16)

  ✔ Currency transactions now have index on userid instead of dateadded(???) @done(21-05-03 17:36)

  ✔ Moved strings and other .yml back to data, to avoid numerous problems that would arise in installers/scripts by having another 'data' folder @done(21-05-03 17:44)

  ✔ Added initial version of the pubsub implementation which may be used to synchronize configs across shards, with local implementation for bots with a single shard. Experimental @done(21-05-03 17:52)

    ✔ OkColor, ErrorColor, Locale, ConsoleOutputType, ForwardMessages, ForwardmessagesToAllOwners, Prefix, GroupGreets, DmHelpString and HelpString have been moved to and are being loaded from data/bot.yml. They also had their names changed. Use `.bce` command to see the new names @done(21-05-05 17:41)
    ✔ `.bce <name>` will now print the value of the config instead of setting it to null (if you want to stop help.dmtext or help.text from occuring, set them to '-') @done(21-05-05 17:41)
    ✔ `.bce <name> <value>` will set the value, as before, but this time to either database or the file based on where the data is saved. @done(21-05-05 17:41)
