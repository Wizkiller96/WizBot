  webSearchEngine: Google
  # what will be used for .img command. Either google (official api) or searx
  imgSearchEngine: Google
  # how will yt results be retrieved: ytdataapi or ytdl or ytdlp
  ytProvider: YtDataApiv3
  # in case web or img search is set to searx, the following instances will be used:
  searxInstances: []
  # in case ytProvider is set to invidious, the following instances will be used
  invidiousInstances: []
  ```
- Added new properties to `creds.yml`. google -> searchId and google -> searchImageId.
- These properties are used as `cx` (google api query parameter) in case you've setup your `data/searches.yml` to use the official google api.
  `searchId` is used for web search
  `searchimageId` is used for image search
  ```yml
  google:
      searchId: ""
      searchImageId: ""
  ```
- Check `creds_example.yml` for comments explaining how to obtain them.

#### Patronage system added
- Added `data/patron.yml` for configuration
- Implemented only for patreon so far
- Patreon subscription code completely rewritten
- Users who pledge on patreon get benefits based on the amount they pledged
- Public wizbot only. But selfhosters can adapt it to their own patreon pages by configuring their patreon credentials in `creds.yml` and enabling the system in `data/patron.yml` file.
  - Most of the patronage system strings are hardcoded atm, so if you wish to use this system on selfhosts, you will have to modify the source
- Pledge amounts are split into tiers. This is not configurable atm.
  - Tier I - 1$ - 4.99$ a month
  - Tier V - 5$ - 9.99$ a month
  - Tier X - 10$ - 19.99$ a month
  - Tier XX - 20$ - 49.99$ a month
  - Tier L - 50$ - 99.99$ a month
  - Tier C - 100$+ a month
- Rewards and command quotas for each of the tiers are configurable
- Limitations to certain features are also configurable. ex:
```yml
quotas:
    features:
        "rero:max_count":
            x: 50
```
- ^ this setting would set the maximum number of reaction roles to be 50 for a user who is in Patron Tier X
- Read the comments in the .yml file for (much) more info
- Quota system allows the owner to set up hourly, daily and monthly quota usage for each tier
- Quota system applies to entire server owner by a patron
  - Patron spends own quota by using the commands on any server
  - Any user on *any* server owned by a patron spends that patron's quota
- When users subscribe to patreon they will receive a welcome message
  - If you're enabling patron system for a selfhost, you will want to edit it

Added `.patron` and `.patronmessage` commands
- `.patron` checks your patronage status, and quotas. Requires patron system to be enabled.
- `.patronmessage` (owner only) sends message to all patrons with the specified tier or higher. Supports embeds

- Added a fake `.cmdcd` command `cleverbot:response` which can be used to limit how often users can talk to the cleverbot.

### Changed

- `.donate` command completely reworked.
  - Works only on public bot (OnlyPublicBotAttribute)
  - Guides user on how to donate to support the project
  - Added interaction explaining selfhosting

- `.google` reimplemented. It now has 2 modes configurable in `data/searches.yml` under the `webSearchengine` property
  - If set to `google`, official custom search api will be used. You will need to set googleapikey and google.searchId in `creds.yml`
  - if set to `searx` one of the instances specified in the `searxInstances:` property will be randomly chosen for each request
    - instances must have `format=json` allowed (public ones usually don't allow it)
    - instances are specified as a fully qualified url, example: `https://my.cool.searx.instance.io`
- `.image` reimplemented. Same as `.google` - it uses either `google` official api (in which case it uses `google.searchImageId` from `creds.yml`) or `searx`

- `.youtube` reimplemented. It will use a `ytProvider:` property from `data/searches.yml` to determine how to retrieve results
  - `ytdataapi` will use the official google api (requires `GoogleApiKey` specified in `creds.yml`) and YoutubeDataApi enabled in the dev console
  - `ytdl` will use `youtube-dl` program from the host machine. It must be downloaded and it's location must be added to path env variable.
  - `ytdlp` will use `yt-dlp` program from the host machine. Same as `youtube-dl` - must be in path env variable.
  - `invidious` will use one of invidious instances specified in the `invidiousInstances` property. Very good.

- `.google`, `.youtube` and `.image` moved to the new Search group

Note: Results of each `.youtube` query will be cached for 1 hour to improve perfomance
- Removed 30 second `.ping` ratelimit on public wizbot

- xp image generation changes
