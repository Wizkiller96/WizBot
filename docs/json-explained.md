## Setting up your Credentials

This document aims to guide you through the process of setting up the credentials necessary for the bot installed on your computer to be able to log into that account.

---

#### Setting up credentials.json file

- **For Windows (Updater)**: the `credentials.json` file is located in the `system` folder. You can access it through the updater by clicking on the `Creds` button.  
- **For Windows (Source), Linux and OSX**: the `credentials.json` file is located in the `WizBot/src/WizBot` folder.

---

##### Getting the Bot's Token:

- On the **Bot** tab of your [applications page][DiscordApp], copy your `Token`.
    - *Note: Your bot Token **is not** the Client Secret! We won't need the Client Secret for anything.*
- Paste your bot token **between** the quotation marks on the **`"Token"`** line of your `credentials.json`.

It should look like this:

```json
"Token": "MTc5MzcyXXX2MDI1ODY3MjY0.ChKs4g.I8J_R9XX0t-QY-0PzXXXiN0-7vo",
```

##### Getting Owner ID*(s)* & Admin ID*(s)*:

- Go to your Discord server and attempt to mention yourself, but put a backslash at the start
  *(to make it slightly easier, add the backslash after the mention has been typed)*.
- For example, the message `\@fearnlj01#3535` will appear as `<@145521851676884992>` after you send the message.
- The message will appear as a mention if done correctly. Copy the numbers from it **`145521851676884992`** and replace the big number on the `OwnerIds` section with your user ID.
- Save the `credentials.json` file.
- If done correctly, you should now be the bot owner. You can add multiple owners or admins by seperating each owner ID or admin ID with a comma within the square brackets.

For a single owner or admin, it should look like this:

```json
"OwnerIds": [
    105635576866156544
],
"AdminIds": [
    105635576866156544
],
```

For multiple owners or admins, it should look like this (pay attention to the commas, the last ID should **never** have a comma next to it):

```json
"OwnerIds": [
    105635123466156544,
    145521851676884992,
    341420590009417729
],
"AdminIds": [
    105635123466156544,
    145521851676884992,
    341420590009417729
],
```

## Setting up your API keys

This part is completely optional, **however it's necessary for music and a few other features to work properly**.

- **GoogleAPIKey**
    - Required for Youtube Song Search, Playlist queuing, and a few more things.
    - Follow these steps on how to setup Google API keys:
        - Go to [Google Console][Google Console] and log in.
        - Create a new project (name does not matter).
        - Once the project is created, go into **`Library`**
        - Under the **`YouTube APIs`** section, enable `YouTube Data API`
        - On the left tab, access **`Credentials`**,
            - Click `Create Credentials` button,
            - Click on `API Key`
            - A new window will appear with your `Google API key`  
              *NOTE: You don't really need to click on `RESTRICT KEY`, just click on `CLOSE` when you are done.*
            - Copy the key.
        - Open up **`credentials.json`** and look for **`"GoogleAPIKey"`**, paste your API key inbetween the quotation marks.
        - It should look like this:
        ```json
        "GoogleApiKey": "AIzaSyDSci1sdlWQOWNVj1vlXxxxxxbk0oWMEzM",
        ```
- **MashapeKey**
    - Required for Hearthstone cards.
    - Api key obtained on https://rapidapi.com (register -> go to MyApps -> Add New App -> Enter Name -> Application key)
    - Copy the key and paste it into `credentials.json`
- **OsuApiKey**
    - Required for Osu commands
    - You can get this key [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api).
- **CleverbotApiKey**
    - Required if you want to use Cleverbot. It's currently a paid service.
    - You can get this key [here](http://www.cleverbot.com/api/).
- **PatreonAccessToken**
    - For Patreon creators only.
- **PatreonCampaignId**
    - For Patreon creators only. Id of your campaign.
- **TwitchClientId**
    - Mandatory for following twitch streams with `.twitch` (or `.stadd` with twitch link)
    - Go to [apps page](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) on twitch and register your application.
    - You need 2FA enabled on twitch in order to create an application
    - You can set `http://localhost` as the OAuth Redirect URL (and press Add button)
    - Select `Chat Bot` from the Category dropdown
    - Once created, clicking on your application will show a new Client ID field
    - Copy it to your credentials.json as shown below
    - *(if you're adding it as the last key inside your credentials.json, remove the trailling comma from the example below)*
    ```json
    "TwitchClientId": "516tr61tr1qweqwe86trg3g",
    ```
- **LocationIqApiKey**
    - Optional. Used only for the `.time` command. https://locationiq.com api key (register and you will receive the token in the email). 
- **TimezoneDbApiKey**
    - Optional. Used only for the `.time` command. https://timezonedb.com api key (register and you will receive the token in the email **YOU HAVE TO ACTIVEATE IT AFTER YOU GET IT**).
- **CoinmarketcapApiKey**
    - Optional. Used only for the `.crypto` command. You can use crypto command without it, but you might get ratelimited from time to time, as all self-hosters share the default api key. https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/

##### Additional Settings

- **TotalShards**
    - Required if the bot will be connected to more than 2500 servers.
    - Most likely unnecessary to change until your bot is added to more than 2500 servers.
- **RedisOptions**
    - Required if the Redis instance is not on localhost or on non-default port.
    - You can find all available options [here](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Configuration.html).
- **RestartCommand**
    - Required if you want to be able to use the `.restart` command
    - If you're using the CLI installer or Linux/OSX, it's easier and more reliable setup WizBot with auto-restart and just use `.die`

For Windows (Updater), add this to your `credentials.json`

```json
"RestartCommand": {
    "Cmd": "WizBot.exe"
},
```

For Windows (Source), Linux or OSX, add this to your `credentials.json`

```json
"RestartCommand": {
    "Cmd": "dotnet",
    "Args": "run -c Release"
},
```

---

#### End Result

**This is an example of how the `credentials.json` looks like with multiple owners, the restart command (optional) and all the API keys (also optional):**

```json

}
```

## Database

WizBot saves all settings and data in the database file `WizBot.db`, located in:

- Windows (Updater): `system/data` (can be easily accessed through the `Data` button on the updater)
- Windows (Source), Linux and OSX: `WizBot/src/WizBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/data/WizBot.db`

In order to open it you will need [SQLite Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

*NOTE: You don't have to worry if you don't have the `WizBot.db` file, it gets automatically created once you successfully run the bot for the first time.*

**To make changes:**

- Shut your bot down.
- Copy the `WizBot.db` file to someplace safe. (Back up)
- Open it with SQLite Browser.
- Go to the **Browse Data** tab.
- Click on the **Table** drop-down list.
- Choose the table you want to edit.
- Click on the cell you want to edit.
- Edit it on the right-hand side.
- Click on **Apply**.
- Click on **Write Changes**.

## Sharding your bot

- **ShardRunCommand**
    - Command with which to run shards 1+
    - Required if you're sharding your bot on windows using .exe, or in a custom way.
    - This internally defaults to `dotnet`
    - For example, if you want to shard your WizBot which you installed using windows installer, you would want to set it to something like this: `C:\Program Files\WizBot\system\WizBot.exe`
- **ShardRunArguments**
    - Arguments to the shard run command
    - Required if you're sharding your bot on windows using .exe, or in a custom way.
    - This internally defaults to `run -c Release --no-build -- {0} {1} {2}` which will be enough to run linux and other 'from source' setups
    - {0} will be replaced by the `shard ID` of the shard being ran, {1} by the shard 0's process id, and {2} by the port shard communication is happening on
    - If shard0 (main window) is closed, all other shards will close too
    - For example, if you want to shard your WizBot which you installed using windows installer, you would want to set it to `{0} {1} {2}`
- **ShardRunPort**
    - Bot uses a random UDP port in [5000, 6000] range for communication between shards
