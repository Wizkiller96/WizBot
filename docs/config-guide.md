# Config  
`.config` is the new `.bce`, it gives you a fast and easy way to edit most bot settings/values. Use `.h .config` for explanation.  

Use `.config` to see the list of editable config files  
Use `.config <config-name>` to see the list of settable properties on that config  
Use `.config <config-name> <setting>` to see the current value and description   
Use `.config <config-name> <setting> value` to set a new value  

All settings are only available if you edit `data/[config-name].yml` files manually.  
If you edit the files manually, you can reload configuration with `.configreload <config-name>`
