Permissions Overview
===================
Have you ever felt confused or even overwhelmed when trying to set WizBot's permissions? In this guide we will be explaining how to use the 
permission commands correctly and even cover a few common questions! Every command we discuss here can be found in the [Commands List](Coming Soon).

**To see the old guide for versions 0.9 and below, see [here](https://github.com/Wizkiller96/WizBot-Old/)**

Why do we use the Permissions Commands?
------------------------------
Permissions are very handy at setting who can use what commands in a server. By default, the NSFW module is blocked, but nothing else is. If something is a bot owner only command, it can only be ran by the bot owner, the person who is running the bot, or has their ID in [`credentials.json`](Coming Soon). 

The Administration module still requires that you have the correct permissions on Discord to be able to use these commands, so for users to be able to use commands like `.kick` and `.prune`, they need kick and mange messages permissions respectively.

With the permissions system it possible to restrict who can skip the current song, pick NadekoFlowers or use the NSFW module.

First Time Setup
------------------
To change permissions you **must** meet the following requirement:

**Have the role specified by `;permrole` (By default, this is WizBot)**

If you have an existing role called `WizBot` but can't assign it to yourself, create a new role called `WizBot` and assign that to yourself.

If you would like to set a different role, such as `Admins`, to be the role required to edit permissions, do `;permrole Admins` (you must have the current permission role to be able to do this).

Basics & Hierarchy
-----
The [Commands List](Coming Soon) is a great resource which lists **all** the available commands, however we'll go over a few commands here.

Firstly, let's explain how the permissions system works - It's simple once you figure out how each command works!
The permissions system works as a chain, everytime a command is used, the permissions chain is checked. Starting from the top of the chain, the command is compared to a rule, if it isn't either allowed or disallowed by that rule it proceeds to check the next rule all the way till it reaches the bottom rule, which allows all commands.

To view this permissions chain, do `;listperms`, with the top of the chain being rule number 1, shown at the top of the message.

If you want to remove a permission from the chain of permissions, do `;removeperm X` to remove rule number X and similarly, do `;moveperm X Y` to move rule number X to number Y (moving, not swapping!).

As an example, if you wanted to enable NSFW for a certain role, say "Lewd", you could do `;rolemdl NSFW enable Lewd`.
This adds the rule to the top of the permissions chain so even if the default `;sm NSFW disabled` rule exists, the "Lewd" role will be able to use the NSFW module.

If you want the bot to notify users why they can't use a command or module, use `;verbose true` and WizBot will tell you what rule is preventing the command.
