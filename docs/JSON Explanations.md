###Setting up your Credentials
If you do not see `credentials.json` you will need to rename `credentials_example.json` to `credentials.json`.

**This is how the unedited credentials look:**
```json
{
  "ClientId": 123123123,
  "BotId": null,
  "Token": "",
  "OwnerIds": [
    0
  ],
  "LoLApiKey": "",
  "GoogleApiKey": "",
  "MashapeKey": "",
  "OsuApiKey": "",
  "SoundCloudClientId": "",
  "CarbonKey": "",
  "Db": null,
  "TotalShards": 1
}
```
####Required Parts
- **Token** - Required to log in. Refer to this [guide](http://discord.kongslien.net/guide.html)
- **OwnerIds** - Required for the **Owner-Only** commands. Seperate multiple Id's with a comma.
- **BotId** - Required for custom reactions to work.  
  - **Important : Bot ID and Client ID will be the same in newer bot accounts due to recent changes by Discord.** 

_BotId and the OwnerIds are **NOT** the names of the owner and the bot. If you do not know the id of your bot, keep the two random numbers in those fields and 
run the bot then do  `.uid @MyBotName` - this will give you your bot_id.
Do the same for yourself with `.uid @MyName` Put these numbers in their respective field of the credentials._

Setting up your API keys

Config.json
===========
`config.json` is now removed with the addition of `WizBot.db` so if you have Nadeko 0.9x follow the [upgrading guide](Coming Soon) to upgrade your bot.

DB files
========
Nadeko uses few db files in order to open these database files `WizBot\src\WizBot\bin\Release\netcoreapp1.0\data\WizBot.db` (1.0) or `data\WizBot.sqlite` (0.9x) you will need [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

To make changes

- go to **Browse Data** tab
- click on **Table** drop-down list
- choose the table you want to edit
- click on the cell you want to edit
- edit it on the right-hand side 
- click on **Apply** 
- click on **Write Changes**

and that will save all the changes.
