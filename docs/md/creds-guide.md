- On the **General Information** tab, copy your `Application ID` from your [applications page][DiscordApp].
- Replace the `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` in this link:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=66186303` with your `Client ID`
- The link should now look something like this:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123123123123&scope=bot&permissions=66186303`
- Access that newly created link, pick your Discord server, click `Authorize` and confirm with the captcha at the end
